A deep link is a link that takes a user directly to a specific screen or location in a mobile app.

In a project I'm currently working on, we were planning to use Firebase Dynamic Links as a means of implementing deep links, but since the service will end on August 25, 2025, we decided to use Universal Links for iOS and App Links for Android. The settings for Universal Links and App Links are described below.
